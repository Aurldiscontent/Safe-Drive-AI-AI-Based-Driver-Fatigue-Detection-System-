# Safe-Drive-AI-AI-Based-Driver-Fatigue-Detection-System-
Safe Drive AI is an advanced driver fatigue detection system designed to enhance road safety by identifying signs of driver drowsiness in real time. Fatigue-related accidents account for a significant percentage of road mishaps worldwide, making early detection crucial. This system leverages AI-powered image processing techniques to monitor key indicators such as eye blinking frequency, yawning patterns, and facial expressions. By using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model integrated with OpenCV and Deep Learning techniques like ResNet, the system continuously analyzes live video feeds to detect fatigue symptoms. Upon detection, it triggers an alert mechanismâ€”such as an audio or visual warningâ€”to prompt the driver to take necessary precautions, ultimately reducing accident risks.

The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, and real-time implementation to ensure accuracy and responsiveness. The combination of computer vision and deep learning enables high-precision detection, even under varying lighting conditions and facial orientations. This AI-based system can be integrated into vehicle dashboards, mobile applications, or standalone hardware solutions, making it a versatile tool for both personal and commercial vehicle safety. By providing real-time alerts, Safe Drive AI contributes to making roads safer by preventing accidents before they happen.
